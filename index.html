        </div>

        <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hello! We are Northern Burlington’s Robotics team, the TecHounds, #5387. Our roster is largely made up of newer members and some veterans. Pranav, Shreyas, and Hadi are captains from last year’s competition and veterans of the club. Other members who are in the club include Daniel, Abhi, Logan, Sumanth, Krish, and Arnav - all have experience of how to build a robot. Daniel is the lead builder. Abhi is the secondary captain for building as well as a major social media executive. Logan is lead for the 3D building team which helps with additional parts and for designing the capstone. Krish is the lead for EDJ with help from Arnav, the 2nd lead for the EDJ. Sumanth is the leader for outreach in order to get different outreach opportunities. Most of the new members who joined our club this year are fairly new to the entirety of FIRST. Six of our Freshmen members, Ridhay, Akhil, Sucheth, Ravikiran, Rithvik, and Srinath have had experience in building and coding in our middle school FLL teams. Our school, Northern Burlington High School is known for its contribution to implement the AP program and includes a diverse amount of electives to give students options as to what they could possibly do as a future career. The school is also known for its agricultural aspect, with clubs such as FFA (Future Farmers of America) and other agricultural electives. Northern Burlington High School also offers an AP Capstone Program, so that students can receive their Associates Degree before college. As far as competitive performance, our team currently holds the title of Deep South NJ League Champion. In addition, we placed 3rd in the Parkway Division of the 2019 Garden State Rumble - New Jersey Championship. Our team also received the Inspire Award at the 2020 Garden State Rumble - New Jersey Championship. We intend to not only keep our title of League Champion, but also to win Garden State Rumble Champions and advance to the World Championship for the first time in our team’s history. In short, we can’t wait to take on the Skystone game challenge and overcome every obstacle it throws at us!

        <p><i>This section only applies to the Full Course (12-week program). If you choose only specifc Test Sections,
                please refer to those sections here.</i></p>
        <p>After the free 30-min consultation, you will take a full practice test under test-day conditions (observing
            all time constraints and breaks). This will serve as a diagnotic test.
            After you take this initial test, you will send me your results; I will then analyze them, determine exactly
            where your strengths and weaknesses are, and develop a lesson plan
            just for you. We will break down all the subject material on the SAT into 3 groups: Reading, Writing, and
            Math.
            We will cover each Test over four weeks, spending one week on each major subcategory within that Test.
            After every four weeks, you will take a timed test to assess your improvement.
